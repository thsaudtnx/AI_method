# Project README

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms, each contained in its respective folder. The goal is to provide a unified environment for testing and analyzing algorithms, complete with configurable parameters and comprehensive output statistics.

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the Algorithm Folder**  
   Each algorithm is organized in its own folder. To run a specific algorithm, navigate to its directory.

2. **Find the `Simulator` Class**  
   Within each algorithm's directory, you'll find a `Simulator` class which serves as the main entry point for running that algorithm.

3. **Configure Parameters**  
   Inside the `Simulator` class, locate the `main` function. This function contains the parameters that can be modified based on your specific requirements.

4. **Execute the `Simulator`**  
   Once parameters are configured, run the `Simulator` class to execute the algorithm. 

5. **Example output:**
